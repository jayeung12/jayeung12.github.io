## **What is ViReMa?**
**ViReMa** is an algorithm developed by the [Routh and Johnson Labs](https://www.utmb.edu/routhlab/home) providing **"a versatile platform for rapid, sensitive and nucleotide-resolution detection of recombination junctions in viral genomes using next-generation sequencing data"**. Code for ViReMa is written in Python and can be downloaded [here](https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/virema/README.html).
